# About Me

Hello there!

Welcome to my page. My name is Fabian Zorn, and I'm a software engineer from Leipzig, Germany.
I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to share a little bit about myself and my passion for software engineering.

## Areas of Expertise
As a software engineer, my expertise lies in Java and Spring Boot development.
I enjoy leveraging the power of Java and Spring Boot to build robust and scalable applications.
My experience extends to working with databases, RESTful APIs, and implementing various design patterns.
Also, I'm experienced with Angular and the programming languages TypeScript and JavaScript.
Furthermore, I have some basic knowledge of Docker and Kubernetes.

## Passion and Philosophy
Software engineering is not just a profession for me; it's my passion.
I believe that technology has the power to transform lives and make the world a better place.
I am driven by a commitment to creating clean, efficient, and maintainable code that meets the needs of businesses and individuals alike.
In doing so, I always strive to implement my code according to the principles of Test-Driven-Development (TDD).
I'm also a huge fan of {{< link href="http://cleancoder.com/products" content="Uncle Bob" >}} and his books.

I am still an enthusiastic hobby photographer as well as an ambitious marathon runner.
I prefer to spend my vacations hiking in the mountains of South Tyrol.

## Continuous Learning
The field of software engineering, and particularly Java and Spring Boot, is constantly evolving.
I'm committed to staying at the forefront of new developments.
I continuously expand my knowledge through reading, attending conferences, and engaging in online courses.
This ensures that I can deliver cutting-edge solutions that leverage the latest technologies and best practices.
